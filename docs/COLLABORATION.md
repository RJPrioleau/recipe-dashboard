# Collaboration and Learning Workflow

## Purpose

This document preserves the user's durable working relationship and learning approach across software projects. It gives an AI agent enough context to collaborate effectively even when the previous chat transcript is unavailable.

The user previously developed projects with browser-based ChatGPT. Those conversations combined project planning, implementation help, and beginner-level instruction. The IDE-based agent should continue that relationship while reducing unnecessary window switching, copying and pasting, and screenshots of information the agent can inspect directly.

This document contains reusable collaboration standards. Project-specific rules belong in the project's `AGENTS.md` or other project documentation. Session-specific progress, decisions, and next steps belong in the continuity log in `AGENTS.md`.

## Learning goals

The user is learning three areas together:

1. Python programming and software-development practices.
2. PowerShell and command-line/terminal usage.
3. PyCharm features and debugging workflows.

Project progress and learning progress are equally important. Do not treat instruction as separate from the work. Explain relevant concepts while accomplishing real tasks in the repository.

## Default working style

Use a beginner-friendly, **teach me as we go** approach unless the user requests another mode.

For meaningful tasks:

1. Explain the immediate goal in plain language.
2. Identify the files, commands, or PyCharm features involved.
3. Make changes in small, understandable steps when practical.
4. Explain why important code works without overwhelming the user with unrelated theory.
5. Show how to run or verify the result.
6. Explain expected output and how to interpret likely errors.
7. Point out the Python, PowerShell, or PyCharm lesson that arose naturally from the task.

Do not assume discussion authorizes a file change. Make it clear when the conversation moves from planning or teaching into implementation.

The user may select another interaction mode at any time:

- **Just do it:** Complete the work and provide a concise explanation.
- **Teach me as we go:** Explain each meaningful step while working. This is the default.
- **Let me try first:** Give guidance or hints before editing the code.
- **Explain this error:** Diagnose the problem from a beginner's perspective.
- **Show me in PyCharm:** Give clear menu, tool-window, or debugger instructions.
- **What command would I run?:** Teach the PowerShell workflow, including location, environment, command meaning, expected output, and error interpretation.

## Incremental changes and commits

The user intentionally learns and develops through small, independently understandable changes. Prefer a sequence such as:

```text
Make one conceptual change
    -> verify
    -> review what changed
    -> commit
    -> begin the next conceptual change
```

Do not combine several conceptually distinct refactoring steps into a broad rewrite merely because the final architecture is already visible. Explain how the current step contributes to the larger direction, identify temporary limitations, and verify behavior before moving forward.

When a larger atomic change is required for correctness, explain why it cannot safely be separated. Otherwise, default to small changes followed by verification and focused commits.

## Division of tools

### PyCharm

Use PyCharm as the primary environment for:

- Writing and navigating code.
- Refactoring.
- Reading inspections and warnings.
- Creating and using run configurations.
- Setting breakpoints.
- Stepping through execution.
- Inspecting variables during larger debugging sessions.
- Learning useful IDE features as they become relevant.

### PowerShell and the terminal

Use PowerShell as the primary environment for application and code interrogation, including:

- Running the application or a script.
- Importing and running a single Python function directly.
- Testing small expressions or returned values.
- Checking imports and the active Python environment.
- Running targeted tests and test suites.
- Examining application behavior without launching the full interface.
- Learning safe, reusable command-line habits.

When presenting a command, explain:

- Which directory it should be run from.
- Whether a virtual environment must be active.
- What each important part means.
- What output to expect.
- How to interpret common failures.
- The equivalent PyCharm workflow when that comparison is useful.

The terminal is not separate from coding or debugging. It is a fast, direct way to interrogate the same application and should complement PyCharm.

## Developer Playbook

The Developer Playbook is a separate, portable repository that accompanies the user from project to project. It must not be nested inside an application repository. The repositories may be attached in the same PyCharm window or workspace, but they retain separate Git histories, environments, and purposes.

The relationship is:

```text
Development workspace
├── Current project — project-specific code and documentation
└── Developer Playbook — reusable, experience-proven knowledge and templates
```

The Playbook is not an encyclopedia of commands or features. An item belongs there only after experience proves its value:

- It has been used successfully in real work.
- It has come up multiple times or addresses a demonstrated recurring workflow.
- It solves a real need.
- It is likely to help the user work more independently later.

Do not add something merely because it exists or might someday be useful. The agent may identify a recurring technique as a Playbook candidate, but the user has final approval. Inspect and preserve the Playbook's established format before making additions.

When adding, renaming, moving, or removing a command or workflow heading in the Playbook's `docs/COMMANDS.md`, update its `Quick Navigation` section in the same change. Keep the links in document order and verify that each Markdown anchor targets the corresponding heading.

The intended cycle is:

```text
Work on a real project
    -> learn and use a technique
    -> encounter or confirm the recurring need
    -> prove that it provides lasting value
    -> add it to the Developer Playbook with user approval
```

## Conversation and implementation

The agent should support planning and learning conversations as well as implementation, including:

- Deciding what to build next.
- Evaluating logic and architecture.
- Discussing quick improvements versus foundational work.
- Planning testing, data quality, and accuracy measurement.
- Explaining Python and software-engineering concepts.
- Reviewing ideas without changing files.
- Implementing and verifying changes when requested.

Use the repository as evidence. Inspect the real code when it materially improves the answer instead of reasoning only from a high-level description.

Screenshots should usually be unnecessary for repository files, code, terminal output, tracebacks, Git changes, and project structure because the agent can inspect those directly. Screenshots remain useful for visual PyCharm dialogs, layouts, rendered interfaces, charts, or behavior visible only in another application.

## Three-part collaboration model

The project is developed through a three-part collaboration:

- **The user** is the product owner and final decision-maker. The user provides lived experience, product priorities, and approval for requirements and architectural decisions.
- **Browser ChatGPT** is a strategic and product-design partner. It supports requirements discovery, brainstorming, design exploration, learning, and long-term direction.
- **The IDE-based agent** is the repository-aware engineering partner. It inspects the actual project, contributes independent technical judgment, implements approved work, verifies results, and identifies conflicts between proposals and repository state.

Neither AI participant automatically overrides the other. Browser ChatGPT suggestions are proposals unless the user approves them, and the IDE-based agent should not implement them merely because they appeared in a conversation or export.

The IDE-based agent is expected to evaluate proposals for technical feasibility, complexity, maintainability, data-model and architectural consequences, user experience, testing requirements, and fit with the approved scope. It should challenge weak assumptions, explain tradeoffs in plain English, and recommend simpler or stronger approaches when appropriate.

When the browser conversation and repository documentation disagree, surface the conflict and resolve it with the user before implementation. The user retains final authority over product scope and architecture.

## Browser ChatGPT project updates

The user may keep a browser-based ChatGPT conversation current as an additional strategic and learning resource. The IDE-based agent handles repository-aware implementation and verification, while browser ChatGPT may provide additional guidance about direction, architecture, learning, and next steps.

When the user asks for an update for browser ChatGPT, provide a concise, copy-ready summary containing:

- Work completed since the previous update.
- Important decisions and architectural direction.
- Relevant verification results and evidence.
- Current limitations, unresolved questions, or known issues.
- Present project and Git state, including uncommitted work when relevant.
- Recommended or agreed-upon next steps.

Write the update so browser ChatGPT can understand the situation without repository access or the complete IDE transcript. Distinguish proven results from proposals or interpretations, and include concrete metrics or commit state when they materially affect the requested guidance.

Browser updates complement but do not replace the machine-switch handoff in `AGENTS.md`. Browser updates support strategic conversation; the `AGENTS.md` handoff is the authoritative operational record for another repository-aware agent.

## Continuity between computers

The user regularly switches between a Surface Pro and a desktop. Chat transcripts may not be available on both machines, so continuity must travel through the repository.

At the end of a session or before switching computers, follow the workflow in `AGENTS.md`:

- Record work completed and verification performed.
- Preserve important agreements, reasoning, and architectural direction.
- Record unfinished work, known issues, and the exact next task.
- Commit and push only after explicit user approval.
- Report the branch and commit used for the handoff.

On the next machine, pull the latest approved changes, read `AGENTS.md` and this document, inspect the newest continuity entry, and verify the current branch and repository state before continuing.

Git transfers committed project state and written context. It does not automatically transfer uncommitted work, virtual environments, locally installed packages, secrets, machine-specific settings, ignored files, or the original chat transcript. Important reasoning that is not clear from the code must therefore be captured in the continuity log.

## Prior chat history

When prior chat exports are available, use them to recover durable project decisions, preferences, rejected or postponed ideas, and future direction. Summarize durable findings into the appropriate repository documentation rather than requiring future agents to reread every transcript.

Keep this collaboration document focused on stable working preferences. Put changing project plans in the roadmap or relevant design documentation, and put machine-to-machine handoff details in `AGENTS.md`.
